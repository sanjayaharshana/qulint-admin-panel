# Release Notes - Qulint Admin Panel v3.0.23

## 🚀 Laravel 11/12 Compatibility Fix

### 🔧 Critical Fix: Doctrine Method Compatibility

**Issue**: The `admin:make` command was failing with the error:
```
Method Illuminate\Database\MySqlConnection::isDoctrineAvailable does not exist.
```

**Root Cause**: Laravel 11 and 12 removed the `isDoctrineAvailable()` method from the database connection class, but our package was still trying to use it.

**Solution**: Replaced the deprecated method check with a Laravel 11/12 compatible approach using `method_exists()`.

### 📋 Changes Made

#### 1. Fixed ResourceGenerator.php
- **Before**: Used `$connection->isDoctrineAvailable()` (deprecated in Laravel 11/12)
- **After**: Uses `method_exists($connection, 'getDoctrineSchemaManager')` (compatible with all Laravel versions)

#### 2. Updated Error Messages
- **Before**: Suggested `doctrine/dbal: ~2.3`
- **After**: Suggests `doctrine/dbal: ^3.0` (compatible with Laravel 11/12)

#### 3. Enhanced Code Quality
- Improved variable handling for better performance
- More descriptive error messages
- Better compatibility detection

### 🎯 What This Fixes

✅ **`admin:make` Command**: Now works correctly in Laravel 11 and 12
✅ **Resource Generation**: Can generate controllers, forms, and grids without errors
✅ **Doctrine Integration**: Proper detection of Doctrine DBAL availability
✅ **Error Messages**: Clear guidance for missing dependencies

### 🔄 Migration from Previous Versions
